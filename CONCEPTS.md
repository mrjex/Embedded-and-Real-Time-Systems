## Pointers
Pointers are variables storing memory addresses of other variables. Key implementations include:
- Basic pointer operations (`/workpackages/exercise4`)
- Bonus point assignments (`/bonus-points/bp-1`)
- Advanced practice (`/spare-time-practice`)

### Function Pointers
Implementation of function pointers demonstrating:
- Memory address manipulation
- Function callbacks
- Dynamic dispatch
Location: `/workpackages/WP2/E1`

### Sorting Algorithms
Implementation of:
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based sorting
- **Selection Sort**: In-place comparison sorting
Location: `/workpackages/WP4/E4`

## Memory Management

### Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Runtime memory allocation using `malloc()` and `calloc()`
- Datatype-specific allocation
- Custom struct handling
- Heap memory management

### Static Memory Allocation
- Pre-execution memory allocation
- Fixed memory allocation
- Stack memory utilization

## Bitwise Operations
Advanced bit manipulation including:
- Base conversion pipeline
- Binary operations
- Hexadecimal conversion
Location: `/workpackages/WP2/E4`

## Local Database Implementation
Binary file operations including:
- CRUD operations
- Struct-based data storage
- File handling
Location: `/workpackages/WP2/E3`

## Linked List Implementation
Advanced data structure implementation:
- Pointer-based node connections
- Custom struct integration
- Dynamic memory management
Location: `/WP2/E2`
