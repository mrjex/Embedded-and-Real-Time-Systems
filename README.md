## Overview

This project was developed during January - March 2024 in collaboration with two other students. The course consisted of 6 comprehensive work packages focusing on:
- Advanced C/C++ programming concepts
- TinkerCad simulation
- Hardware implementation
- Real-time system development

## Core Concepts

### Pointers
Pointers are variables storing memory addresses of other variables. Key implementations include:
- Basic pointer operations (`/workpackages/exercise4`)
- Bonus point assignments (`/bonus-points/bp-1`)
- Advanced practice (`/spare-time-practice`)

#### Function Pointers
Implementation of function pointers demonstrating:
- Memory address manipulation
- Function callbacks
- Dynamic dispatch
Location: `/workpackages/WP2/E1`

#### Sorting Algorithms
Implementation of:
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based sorting
- **Selection Sort**: In-place comparison sorting
Location: `/workpackages/WP4/E4`

### Memory Management

#### Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Runtime memory allocation using `malloc()` and `calloc()`
- Datatype-specific allocation
- Custom struct handling
- Heap memory management

#### Static Memory Allocation
- Pre-execution memory allocation
- Fixed memory allocation
- Stack memory utilization

### Bitwise Operations
Advanced bit manipulation including:
- Base conversion pipeline
- Binary operations
- Hexadecimal conversion
Location: `/workpackages/WP2/E4`

### Local Database Implementation
Binary file operations including:
- CRUD operations
- Struct-based data storage
- File handling
Location: `/workpackages/WP2/E3`

### Linked List Implementation
Advanced data structure implementation:
- Pointer-based node connections
- Custom struct integration
- Dynamic memory management
Location: `/WP2/E2`

## Hardware Integration

### TinkerCad Simulation (Work Packages 3-6)
Progressive development from software to hardware:
- Circuit design
- Component integration
- Real-time simulation
