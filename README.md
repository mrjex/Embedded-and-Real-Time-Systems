## Overview

This project was developed during January - March 2024 in collaboration with two other students. The course consisted of 6 comprehensive work packages focusing on:
- Advanced C/C++ programming concepts
- TinkerCad simulation
- Hardware implementation
- Real-time system development

## Hardware Integration

### TinkerCad Simulation (Work Packages 3-6)
Progressive development from software to hardware:
- Circuit design
- Component integration
- Real-time simulation
